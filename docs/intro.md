## Architecture

### Master Node Components
The master node is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster. It oversees the nodes and the pods running within the cluster. Key components of the master node include:

- **API Server:** Exposes the Kubernetes API, acting as the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.
- **Etcd:** A consistent and highly-available key-value store used for all cluster data.
- **Scheduler:** Assigns workloads to the worker nodes based on resource availability.
- **Controller Manager:** Runs controller processes to regulate the state of the cluster, handling tasks like node failures and endpoint management.
- **Cloud Controller Manager:** Manages cloud-specific controller processes.

### Worker Node Components
Worker nodes run the applications and handle the containerized workloads. Each worker node has its own set of components:

- **Kubelet:** Ensures that containers are running in a pod by communicating with the master node.
- **Kube-proxy:** Maintains network rules and handles network communication within and outside the cluster.
- **Container Runtime:** Runs the containers. Common runtimes include Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.
