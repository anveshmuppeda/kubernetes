## Introduction
In the dynamic world of containerized applications and microservices, monitoring is indispensable for maintaining the health, performance, and reliability of your infrastructure. Kubernetes, with its ability to orchestrate containers at scale, introduces new challenges and complexities in monitoring. This is where tools like Prometheus and Grafana come into play.     
**Prometheus** is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. It excels at monitoring metrics and providing powerful query capabilities against time-series data. Meanwhile, **Grafana** complements Prometheus by offering visualization capabilities through customizable dashboards and graphs.     
- In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of setting up Prometheus and Grafana on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a robust monitoring solution that allows you to:   
- Collect and store metrics from your Kubernetes cluster and applications.
Visualize these metrics through intuitive dashboards.  
- Set up alerts based on predefined thresholds or anomalies.    
- Gain insights into the performance and resource utilization of your cluster. 



Whether you are deploying your first Kubernetes cluster or looking to enhance your existing monitoring setup, understanding how to leverage Prometheus and Grafana effectively is essential. Let‚Äôs dive into the step-by-step process of deploying and configuring these powerful tools on Kubernetes.

### Prerequisites
Before we get started, ensure you have the following: 

- A running Kubernetes cluster.  

- kubectl command-line tool configured to communicate with your cluster.
- Helm (the package manager for Kubernetes) installed.

### Setting up Prometheus and Grafana
**Step 1: Adding the Helm Repository**

First, add the Prometheus community Helm repository and update it:

```yaml
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```


**Step 2: Installing Prometheus and Grafana**

Create a custom-values.yaml file to customize the Helm chart installation. This file will configure Prometheus and Grafana to be exposed via NodePorts.   
```yaml
# custom-values.yaml
prometheus:
  service:
    type: NodePort
grafana:
  service:
    type: NodePort
```


Then, install the kube-prometheus-stack using Helm:
```yaml
helm upgrade --install kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -f custom-values.yaml
```
Output:
```yaml
$ helm upgrade --install kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -f custom-values.yaml
Release "kube-prometheus-stack" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: kube-prometheus-stack
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Jun 16 17:04:53 2024
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
kube-prometheus-stack has been installed. Check its status by running:
  kubectl --namespace default get pods -l "release=kube-prometheus-stack"

Visit https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus for instructions on how to create & configure Alertmanager and Prometheus instances using the Operator.
```
**Step 3: Verifying the Installation**

After the installation, you can verify that the Prometheus and Grafana services are created and exposed on NodePorts:
```yaml
kubectl get services
```
You should see output similar to this, showing the services with their respective NodePorts:  
```yaml
$ kubectl get services                                   
NAME                                             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                         AGE

kubernetes                                       ClusterIP   10.245.0.1       <none>        443/TCP                         57d
prometheus-operated                              ClusterIP   None             <none>        9090/TCP                        5m19s
```
**Step 4: Accessing Prometheus and Grafana**

To access Prometheus and Grafana dashboards outside the cluster, you need the external IP of any node in the cluster and the NodePorts on which the services are exposed.  


Get the external IP addresses of your nodes:
```yaml
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

You should see output similar to this:

```yaml
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME                   STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP      OS-IMAGE                         KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
pool-t5ss0fagn-jeb47   Ready    <none>   57d   v1.29.1   10.124.0.2    146.190.55.222   Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)   6.1.0-17-amd64   containerd://1.6.28
```

Use the external IP of any node and the NodePorts to access the dashboards: 


Prometheus: http://146.190.55.222:30090   
Grafana: http://146.190.55.222:31519

These steps allow us to easily integrate any dashboard from the Grafana library.  


### Prometheus Architecture

Prometheus is a powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. Understanding its architecture helps in leveraging its full potential. The Prometheus architecture comprises several key components:  

![img](./img/animated-promethes-and-grafana.png.gif)

### Prometheus Server

The Prometheus server is the core component responsible for:  

1. **Data Scraping:** Prometheus periodically scrapes metrics from configured targets, which are typically HTTP endpoints exposing metrics in a specified format.   
2. **Data Storage**: It stores all scraped samples locally using a time series database. Prometheus is designed to be efficient with both storage and retrieval of time series data.    
3. **Querying:** Prometheus allows you to query the time series data via the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL), which enables complex aggregations and calculations.  

### Prometheus Components  

1. **Prometheus Server:** The main component that does the bulk of the work, including scraping metrics from targets, storing the data, and providing a powerful query interface.   
2. **Pushgateway:** An intermediary service used for pushing metrics from short-lived jobs that cannot be scraped directly by Prometheus. This is particularly useful for batch jobs and other processes with a finite lifespan.   
3. **Exporters:** Exporters are used to expose metrics from third-party systems as Prometheus metrics. For example, Node Exporter collects hardware and OS metrics from a node, while other exporters exist for databases, web servers, and more.    
4. **Alertmanager:** This component handles alerts generated by the Prometheus server. It can deduplicate, group, and route alerts to various receivers such as email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other notification systems.   
5. **Service Discovery:** Prometheus supports various service discovery mechanisms to automatically find targets to scrape. This includes static configuration, DNS-based service discovery, and integrations with cloud providers and orchestration systems like Kubernetes.  
6. **PromQL:** The powerful query language used by Prometheus to retrieve and manipulate time series data. PromQL supports a wide range of operations such as arithmetic, aggregation, and filtering.  

### Data Flow in Prometheus

1. **Scraping Metrics:** Prometheus scrapes metrics from HTTP endpoints (targets) at regular intervals. These targets can be predefined or discovered dynamically through service discovery.  
2. **Storing Metrics:** Scraped metrics are stored as time series data, identified by a metric name and a set of key-value pairs (labels).  
3. **Querying Metrics:** Users can query the stored metrics using PromQL. Queries can be executed via the Prometheus web UI, HTTP API, or integrated with Grafana for visualization.  
4. **Alerting:** Based on predefined rules, Prometheus can evaluate metrics data and trigger alerts. These alerts are sent to Alertmanager, which then processes and routes them to the appropriate notification channels.  

### Example of Prometheus Workflow  

1. **Service Discovery:** Prometheus discovers targets to scrape metrics from using service discovery mechanisms. For example, in a Kubernetes environment, it discovers pods, services, and nodes.  
2. **Scraping:** Prometheus scrapes metrics from discovered targets at defined intervals. Each target is an endpoint exposing metrics in a format Prometheus understands (typically plain text).   
3. **Storing:** Scraped metrics are stored in Prometheus‚Äôs time series database, indexed by the metric name and labels.  
4. **Querying:** Users can query the data using PromQL for analysis, visualization, or alerting purposes.   
5. **Alerting:** When certain conditions are met (defined by alerting rules), Prometheus generates alerts and sends them to Alertmanager.   
6. **Alertmanager:** Alertmanager processes the alerts, deduplicates them, groups them if necessary, and sends notifications to configured receivers.  

### Understanding the Kubernetes Objects  

The Helm chart deploys various Kubernetes objects to set up Prometheus and Grafana.  
```yaml
$ kubectl get all
